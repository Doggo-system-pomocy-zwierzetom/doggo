# Doggo.

The Doggo application focuses on functionalities related to general animal assistance. Its activities are based on supporting shelters in finding homes for homeless animals and rescuing lost pets with owners. The web application allows logged-in users to report missing animals. This can be easily done using a simple form and a map. Everyone has access to the map of missing animals, where pins with information about currently missing animals are displayed. Shelters can also take advantage of the option to report animals for adoption and share their needs for various types of supplies available at their shelter. The application displays information to users about shelter needs and allows them to express interest in adoption. Each logged-in user has the ability to view and delete their own submissions and adoptions (in the case of shelters) made through their account.

Unregistered users will only be able to access information within the application. To submit reports, a user account is required. Each account is assigned a role, given during registration. There are two types of profiles: private users (individuals) and shelters.
